Q6: The difference between a singly linked list and a circularly linked list
is that while a singly linked list has a defined head and a null pointer to indicate the end of the list,
a circularly linked list has no ending null pointer as it loops back to the first element after reaching the tail.
There's no real beginning, you can start anywhere, and it just keeps going around in order without a stopping point.

Q7: Linked lists are preferred to arrays when you don't know how many elements you'll need,
or when you know that you want to change the order of elements or insert elements into the list.

Q8: One possible use case for a circularly linked list is implementing a queue. Since the list is circular
it serves well to a FIFO model where the first element in can be the first element out. Another possible use case
is something like a card game with multiple players. It starts at one player, goes all the way around to the last
person that hasn't yet had a turn, and then goes back to the first person that had their turn.
